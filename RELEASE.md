# Release process

## Versioning

JumpWire follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This makes it simple to determine which part of the version number needs to be incremented:

- Major releases contain breaking changes
- Minor releases contain new backwards-compatible functionality
- Patch releases contain only bug fixes

## Shipping a new release

1. Ensure /CHANGELOG.md is updated with all user-relevant changes under a header labeled `UNRELEASED`
1. Run `mix bump [major|minor|patch]`
1. Push the autogenerated commit and tag to GitHub

A new Docker image is automatically built from the tagged commit using GitHub Actions.
